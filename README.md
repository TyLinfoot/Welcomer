# Welcomer - Welcome people to your server with style.

To get started, simply download node.js on your computer, and head over to discordapp.com/developers/applications. Follow an online tutorial and create a bot, then get the token. Download the bot files, and edit the config to your liking.

After you've edited the config, navigate to the folder with your files. Run the following;

npm init
npm install discord.js

Then run node index.js and you should be up and running! 

If you need any help DM me on Discord, Ty#7904.
